  d.concept_code     AS child_concept_code,
  d.concept_class_id AS child_concept_class_id,
  d.vocabulary_id    AS child_concept_vocab_id
FROM concept_ancestor AS ca
  JOIN concept AS d ON ca.descendant_concept_id = d.concept_id
WHERE ca.min_levels_of_separation = 1
      AND ca.ancestor_concept_id = 192671 -- PARAMETER
      AND sysdate BETWEEN d.valid_start_date AND d.valid_end_date -- PARAMETER
;
