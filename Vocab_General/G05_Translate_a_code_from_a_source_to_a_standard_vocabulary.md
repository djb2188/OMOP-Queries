# G05: Translate a code from a source to a standard vocabulary.

This query enables search of all Standard Vocabulary concepts that are mapped to a code from a specified source vocabulary. It will return all possible concepts that are mapped to it, as well as the target vocabulary. The source code could be obtained using queries G02 or G03.
Note that to unambiguously identify a source code, the vocabulary id has to be provided, as source codes are not unique identifiers across different vocabularies.

## Sample query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c1.domain_id        AS source_domain,
  c2.concept_id       AS concept_id,
  c2.concept_name     AS concept_name,
  c2.concept_code     AS concept_code,
  c2.concept_class_id AS concept_class,
  c2.vocabulary_id    AS concept_vocabulary_id,
  c2.domain_id        AS target_concept_domain
FROM concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN concept AS c1 ON c1.concept_id = cr.concept_id_1
  JOIN concept AS c2 ON c2.concept_id = cr.concept_id_2
WHERE cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to'
      AND c1.concept_code IN ('070.0') -- PARAMETER
      AND c1.vocabulary_id = 'ICD9CM' -- PARAMETER
      AND sysdate BETWEEN cr.valid_start_date AND cr.valid_end_date -- PARAMETER
;
```
### Input

| Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Source Code List |  '070.0' |  Yes |  Source codes are alphanumeric |
|  Source Vocabulary ID |  'ICD9CM' |  Yes | The source vocabulary ID is mandatory, because the source code is not unique across different vocabularies. |
|  As of date |  Sysdate |  No | Valid record as of specific date. Current date â€“ sysdate is a default |

### Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Source_Domain |  Domain of source concept |
|  Target_Concept_Id |  Concept ID of mapped concept |
|  Target_Concept_Name |  Name of mapped concept |
|  Target_Concept_Code |  Concept code of mapped concept |
|  Target_Concept_Class |  Class of the mapped concept |
|  Target_Concept_Vocab_ID |  Vocabulary ID of the target vocabulary |
|  Target_Concept_Domain |  Vocabulary domain that includes the entity. The domains include: DRUG, CONDITION, PROCEDURE, OBSERVATION, OBSERVATION UNIT, VISIT, DEMOGRAPHIC, DEATH, COST, PROVIDER |

### Sample output record

| Field |  Value |
