C06: Translate a given condition to source codes
---
This query allows to search all source codes that are mapped to a SNOMED-CT clinical finding concept. It can be used to translate SNOMED-CT to ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, Read or OXMIS codes.

Input:

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  SNOMED-CT Concept ID |  312327 |  Yes | Concept IDs are numeric. If more than one concept code needs to be translated an IN clause or a JOIN can be used. |
|  Source Vocabulary ID |  2 |  Yes | 2 represents ICD9-CM |
|  As of date |  Sysdate |  No | Valid record as of specific date. Current date â€“ sysdate is a default |

Sample query run:

The following is a sample run of the query to list all source codes that map to a SNOMED-CT concept entered as input. The sample parameter substitutions are highlighted in  blue.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c1.concept_code     AS source_code,
  c1.concept_name     AS source_name,
  c1.vocabulary_id    AS source_vocabulary_id,
  c1.domain_id        AS source_domain_id,
  c2.concept_id       AS target_concept_id,
  c2.concept_name     AS target_concept_name,
  c2.concept_code     AS target_concept_code,
  c2.concept_class_id AS target_concept_class,
  c2.vocabulary_id    AS target_concept_vocab_id
FROM concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN concept AS c1 ON cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id
  JOIN concept AS c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
WHERE
      cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to' AND
  AND c1.domain_id = 'Condition' AND
  AND c1.concept_id = 312327 AND -- PARAMETER
  AND c1.vocabulary_id = 'SNOMED' AND  -- PARAMETER
  AND sysdate BETWEEN c2.valid_start_date AND c2.valid_end_date  -- PARAMETER
;
```
